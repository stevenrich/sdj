            <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="Full Membership">
              <p>
                Full membership is available to those who receive a majority of their income from or spend the majority of their work time involved in journalistic work. This includes freelance work, part time work or full time work for newspapers, magazines, wire services, radio stations or networks, television stations or networks, cable outlets, online-only news organizations, and other bonafide news organizations. Accepted journalistic work includes reporting, writing, editing, fact-checking, photography, anchoring, producing, directing, research, design, teaching journalism and other functions that have direct impact on the gathering or presentation of the news (such as social media). Full membership is not meant for people in public relations, political advocacy or other media careers.
            </p><p>
Full membership is also available to journalists who are currently between jobs, including those who are freelancing. Temporarily unemployed journalists are eligible for free membership or reduced dues for the first three years they are unemployed through a special application. 
</p><p>
Full members who take a medical leave of absence from journalism or working are eligible to stay in this category for at least three years if they were a full member in good standing for at least one year before the leave of absence and if they are not currently spending a majority of their time on non-journalistic work. 
</p><p>
Full members experiencing financial hardship (such as those who may be temporarily laid off or facing many medical bills), are eligible for reduced fees or free membership through a separate application.
</p><p>
Full members are able to vote on issues presented to members. Full members are eligible to hold office in the organization.
              </p>
